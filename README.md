# Course: **R for Excel Users**

R for Excel Users is an introductory course that helps spreadsheet users transition into data analysis with R. By building on familiar Excel concepts, students learn how to manipulate, clean, and summarize data using R scripts and packages like `dplyr`, `readxl`, and `ggplot2`. 

This course has been strongly inspired in those materials:

 - [R for Excel Users](https://rforexcelusers.com/) (book by John L Taveras)
 - [R for Excel Users](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/) (book by Julie Lowndes & Allison Horst)


The course was conducted in Spanish; therefore, most of the sources in this repository are in Spanish as well.


These resources are organized as follows:

* **01\_diagnostico-excel**: Contains diagnostic materials used to assess students‚Äô prior knowledge and skills in Microsoft Excel.

* **02\_material**: Includes datasets for hands-on exercises, such as Colombian municipal and departmental maps and some educatinal data. Thanks to [Saber data](https://github.com/nebulae-co/saber) and [Colmaps](https://github.com/nebulae-co/colmaps).

* **03\_miscelanea**: A collection of complementary study materials and reference documents.

* **04\_resultados**: A directory designated for storing evaluation results generated during the course.

* **05\_avance**: A workspace for student projects; each student uploads their code in a dedicated personal folder.

### üéØ General Objective of the Course

The course *‚ÄúR for Excel Users‚Äù* is designed to introduce individuals with prior experience in Microsoft Excel to the R programming language. By leveraging students‚Äô practical and intuitive understanding of spreadsheets, the course aims to develop foundational competencies in structured and reproducible data analysis. Through a comparative and hands-on methodology, the course translates common Excel operations‚Äîsuch as filters, formulas, functions, pivot tables, and data structures‚Äîinto the R environment.
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

* Install and use R and RStudio.
* Create and manage reproducible projects.
* Manipulate, transform, and summarize data using the `dplyr` package.
* Read and understand datasets from different formats, especially Excel files.
* Work with text variables, dates, and categorical data.
* Perform basic aggregation, and mapping tasks.
* Understand key conceptual differences between Excel and R (objects, functions, structures).
